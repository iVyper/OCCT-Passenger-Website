					How to Ride the Bus

			<div class="info">
				<ul>
				    <li>Plan ahead.
				        <ul>
				            <li>To find the route nearest to you and its schedule, please refer to our routes and schedules page at: <a href="https://occt.ivyper.dev/pages/routeschedule.html" target="_blank">occt.ivyper.dev/pages/routeschedule</a>.</li>
										<li><b style="color: #4997d0;">Please Note:</b> Weekday and Weekend Service differs, double check you are reading the correct schedule.</li>
				        </ul>
				    </li>
						<li>Know when your bus is scheduled to arrive and be at the stop 5-10 minutes beforehand.
							<ul>
								<li>Wait at designated bus stops only. For your safety buses may only board or alight passengers at designated stops.</li>
								<li>Since other people may be waiting for a different bus please be attentive for your bus, and flag the bus driver down to indicate that you would like to board.</li>
								<li>Have your BU ID card out and ready to scan prior to boarding the bus.
									<ul>
										<li>Unsure of how to scan your ID on the bus? Ask your driver!</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Board at the front door only, unless told otherwise by the driver.</li>
						<li>Do not stand forward of the white line in the front of the bus. This is a federal safety regulation to allow the bus driver a clear field of vision.</li>
						<li>Move to the rear of the bus after boarding, so that as many as possible may board the bus.</li>
						<li>Pull the stop request cord to signal the driver that you would like to exit at the next stop.</li>
						<li>Exit at the rear door. This will expedite the boarding of passengers.</li>
						<li>Do not cross in front of the bus after exiting. Wait until the bus has pulled away from the bus stop and you have a clear field of vision in both directions before crossing the street.</li>

			<div class="info">
				<ul>
				    <li>On days of inclement weather, generally, buses will be overcrowded. Plan to leave early on those days and expect a longer trip.
			        <ul>
			            <li>When boarding a crowded bus, standees should move to the rear of the bus to allow additional passengers to board.</li>
			        </ul>
						</li>
				    <li>Laws require that no passengers stand in front of the line marked on the floor of the bus to ensure that the driver has a clear view and to protect passengers in the case of a sudden stop.</li>
						<li>If you find the bus you are trying to take is consistently full, there are alternative options.
			        <ul>
			            <li>To find a possible alternative route nearest to you, please refer to our routes and schedules page at: <a href="https://occt.ivyper.dev/pages/routeschedule.html" target="_blank">occt.ivyper.dev/pages/routeschedule</a>.</li>

								<li>Buses that are en route will proceed as usual until they reach University Property at which point they will freeze and unload passengers.</li>
